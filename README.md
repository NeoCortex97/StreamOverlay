# StreamOverlay
A python tool that creates stream overlays that consist of unicode characters that form Borders and patterns, so that it looks like The Stream would be played from a terminal ui.

This project should become a Python package at one point.

This tool uses Python and will use the PIL fork pillow to render text to an image, that can be set as an overlay for a stream or video.  

## ToDo:

[X] Generate ascii border.
[X] Generate unicode Border using border characters.
[X] Generate Boxes with random Box characters.
[ ] Calculate character count depending on image size and font size.
[ ] Genrate Image from text.
[ ] Draw nicer shapes with pillow drawing functions.
[ ] Add configuration file.
[ ] Enable multiple config files.
[ ] Make overlay structure configurable via config file.
[ ] Create a script for OBS-Studio to setup scenes based on the output of the generator.
[ ] Enable Automatic update of the overlay.
[ ] Future work. . .
